# sfRESTClient Plugin


This plugin provides a high level API specifically useful for communicating with [RESTful services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).  It depends upon the `sfWebBrowserPlugin` for its ability to make HTTP requests to remote sites.


## Future Plans


### Service-specific Browser Configurations

Allow service-specific browser configuration overrides as follows:

    [yaml]
    browser_conf:
      headers: {}
      adapter_class: ''
      adapter_options: {}


### Remote Entity Schema / ORM?

Implement a schema-like definition of remote objects. Perhaps implement an ORM-like API for remote entities. Potentially even implement REST as a database adaptor for Propel?

    [yaml]
    # potential "schema sketch"
    entities:
      stock:
        param:
          id: { type: int }
